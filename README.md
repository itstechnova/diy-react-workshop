# How to set it up
## Clone this Repo
Here is a pretty useful [Git Guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).   
Run this in your terminal to clone:   
```git clone https://github.com/itstechnova/diy-react-workshop.git```
## Copy your code from your CodeSandbox into Gallery.jsx!
Use your preferred code editor. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)!   

## Run locally
1. Run ```npm -v``` to check if you have npm - our package manager - installed. It should return the version if so.   
2. Run ```npm install``` from the root directory.   
3. Run ```npm start``` from the root directory.    
4. Your application will open up in a web browser! 

## Don't have npm installed? 
Install node.js, this should install npm automatically: https://nodejs.org/en/
## Check out [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
Note you will need to login or create a GitHub account!
## Don't forget to commit and push your changes!
